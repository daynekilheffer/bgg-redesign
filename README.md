# bgg home page redesign implementation
### target

- https://caitlinpannellevans.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/bgg-website-home.jpg

### support

- http://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/
- http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons


### bugs

1. giving focus to input's causes the outline to appear which doesn't conform to the border-radius.  Bootstrap handles this by removing the outline and putting a box-shadow around the input field

### todo
1. need a responsive treatment
2. need to add content to hero carousel
3. need to determine what to do about bgg image copyrights
4. remove use of table styling
5. save a copy of target design into repo in case designer changes the target listed above
