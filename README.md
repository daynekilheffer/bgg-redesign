###bugs

1. giving focus to input's causes the outline to appear which doesn't conform to the border-radius.  Bootstrap handles this by removing the outline and putting a box-shadow around the input field

###todo
1. need a responsive treatment
2. integrate a build system instead of this cli nonsense
